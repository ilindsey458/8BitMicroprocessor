# Custom 8-Bit Microprocessor
---

## This is a WIP

This is a project to build an 8-Bit microprocessor custom architecture using only logic gates. This is a learning project and is not meant to represent an effecient or practical method of developing a proper 8-Bit microprocessor architecture. The idea for this project came from this amazing series of YouTube videos on hardware concepts by Sebastian Lague. ![Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA)

### Main Features
- Logic Gate level microprocessor simulation
- Fully mapped architecture diagram
- Custom OPCode table

### Extensions
- Convert components to be compatible with IRL equivalent pins
- Custom Assembler :)
- AXI compatability (idk how to do this)

## Why make an 8-Bit microprocessor?
Honestly I fell in love with low-level programming because of the youtube series mentioned above and it inspired me to make my own project. I know this project's scope is very large but I really wanted to have a processor that I could call my own, even if it isn't designed perfectly and is only a simulation.

#### Will I make this on real hardware?
That is a very long term goal but before that I would like to upgrade the design to 16-bit because it is much more useful. Before I even start this however I would have to convert my simulation design to use real-world components and learn a lot more about EE to make it work.
